<br>
This is a prototype of a banking system, which demonstrates [Microservice Architecture Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/microservices/) using Spring Boot.
## Technologies
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Hibernate
- jUnit
- Thymeleaf
- Swagger 2
- Lombok

## How to run
```sh
To launch classes Application.java in servecies customerService, accountService and commonService
```
Services commonService, accountService and customerService start on localhost ports 8080, 8081 and 8082 respectively.
Postgre database initialized with some sample user.

## Functional Services
BankSystem was decomposed into three core microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around certain business domains.
